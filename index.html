 	<h1> This is Ice Hockey!</h1>
 	<p>Hockey is an amazing sport that was created in 1875 in Montreal, Canada. Hockey is a very popular sport in North America, as well as in Europe, that is played on an ice surface. The goal of the game is to score more points than your opponent, by shooting the "puck" (which is a small black rubber disk), into the opponents net using your hockey stick. The most popular hockey league in the world is the NHL, which stands for the National Hockey League, and includes teams throughout Canada and the United States.</p>
 	<p> Hockey players have lots of differnt gear. They have protective gear, which includes a helmet, as well as different protective pads that cover their entire body. For footwear, hockey players use "skates", which are boots that have a sharp metal blade on the bottom. The shape of the blade allows players to glide across the ice surface at high speeds, whilst also allowing them to stop, turn, and speed up with ease. The last and most important piece of equipment for hockey players is their stick. The stick is typically around the same height as its user, and features a thin shaft that is connected to a curved, flat head at the end. This is what is used to control the puck, shoot it, pass it, and to "check" your opponents to get the puck from them.</p>
 	<p> Hockey is played with a roster that typically includes 20-30 players. Within this roster, there are different positions. Typically, 1-2 players will be the "goalies", who's goal is to keep the puck out of the net. Around 12-15 players will be "forwards", whos main goal is to try and score by generating offensive pressure on their opponents. This is similar to a striker or midfielder in soccer. Finally, around 6-9 players will play "defense". Their main goal is to protect the goalie and try to stop offensive pressure put on them by their opponents. Each game typically lasts 60 minutes, split into 3, 20 minute periods. If the game ends in a draw at the end of the 60 minutes, there is typically an additional 5 minutes of "Overtime", which is played to sudden death (ie. first to score wins). If there is no winner after that, it will progress to a penalty shootout, similar to that of soccer in order to determine the winner.</p>
